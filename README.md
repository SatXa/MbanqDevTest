# MbanqDevTest
Repository for a small exam from Banq

Small summary:

Q1: Small fun game to rack your brains a bit
Q2: This took me way too long, but it was just as fun. Beware, I tried to add up 9 numbers of up to 10 million digits and 
    I had to leave the PC running the whole night to calculate the answer. While it can surely be improved upon, it does work!
    Q3: Nothing special
Q4: Very short, but cute
Q5: I have previously done similar algorithms, and it was fun to see how much I could shorten it by using LINQ

EDIT: Actually saw multiple improvements that could be made to the algorithms. For example, in Q5 the input can't be too big 
    because the int overflows and the algorithm returns 0
